1) Task Description:
</br>
2) Task Name: Supervised Machine Learning Technique
</br>
3) Task Number: 1
</br>
4) Task Objective: To predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours using simple linear regression.
</br>
5) Dataset: The dataset used for this task is provided by the Sparks Foundation and consists of two columns: "Hours" and "Scores".
</br>
6) Conclusion:
</br>
This task demonstrates the application of a simple linear regression model to predict student scores based on study hours. By analyzing the dataset and training the model, we can make predictions with reasonable accuracy, which can be useful for educational institutions in understanding student performance factors.
